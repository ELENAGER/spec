# Container Storage Interface Addons

The CSI-Addons project hosts extentions to the [CSI specification][csi_spec]
that provide advanced storage operations.

## Volume Replication

The [Volume Replication](replication/README.md) specification provides a
mechanism that Storage Providers can implement to support async-replication
which can be used for disaster recovery operations.
